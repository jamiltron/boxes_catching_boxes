# BOXES CATCHING BOXES

You are a box. Fullfill your dream of catching other boxes, for some reason...

## Instructions

Use left and right to move your box, touch the falling boxes to catch them. Press Escape to quit when you have sufficiently filled said dreams.

## Purpose

This is a very small experiment just to relearn rust.

## TODO
*   Get the types right so I'm not casting all over the place.
*   Add sounds.
*   Add a score readout.
*   Add a main menu.
